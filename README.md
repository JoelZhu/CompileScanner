### üõ†Ô∏è Deploy
To deploy the library as two steps:
1. declare in project's build.gradle as below:
```groovy
dependencies {
    classpath "io.github.joelzhu:scanner-plugin:[RELEASED_VERSION]"
}
```
2. declare in application's build.gradle as below:
```groovy
plugins {
    id 'com.joelzhu.scanner'
}

dependencies {
    implementation "io.github.joelzhu:scanner-runtime:[RELEASED_VERSION]"
}
```
> There's no obvious differences of deploying between using Java and using Kotlin.

### üóíÔ∏è Usage
Quick guide: <a href="#simple-usage">Simple usage</a> | <a href="#advanced-usage-default">Advanced usage: default</a> | <a href="#advanced-usage-priority">Advanced usage: priority</a> | <a href="#description-of-fields">Description of fields</a>

##### Simple usage
For simple usage, coding as below:
```java
@CompileScan
public class ExampleClass implements IExample {}
```
And you have many classes which annotated with ```CompileScan``` as above, then, you don't have to call them one by one, you can acquire those classes esaily. Call the method ```Scanner.getAnnotatedClasses();``` or ```Scanner.getAnnotatedInstances(IExample.class);```, and you will got the classes or array of ```IExample``` instances back.

##### Advanced usage: default
You can use the ```CompileScanner``` as a compilation Proxy. For example, you have a class A as below:
```java
@CompileScan(tag = "ProxySample", isDefault = true)
public class ProxyA implements IProxy {
    @Override
    public String printName() {
        return "I'm A.";
    }
}
```
and you have another class B:
```java
@CompileScan(tag = "ProxySample")
public class ProxyB implements IProxy {
    @Override
    public String printName() {
        return "I'm B.";
    }
}
```
If you call the result like:
```java
final String tag = "ProxySample";
final IProxy[] proxys = Scanner.getAnnotatedInstances(new Options.Builder(tag).create(), IProxy.class);
```
you will got the instance array of ```IProxy.class```, as the ```proxys``` above.  
And when you calling the ```IProxy```'s ```printName()```, like: ```proxys[0].printName();```, you will got the ```I'm B.``` returned back.  
This may help you implement pattern - Proxy easily.

##### Advanced usage: priority
You can set priority of the classes with the same ```tag```.  
For example: If class ```First.class``` has the higher priority of the class ```Second.class```, you can annotated them as below:
```java
@CompileScan(priority = 1)
public class First {}
```
```java
@CompileScan(priority = 2)
public class Second {}
```
And you will got the array, which put the ```First.class``` above the ```Second.class```.
> Lager number has lower priority than the small one.

##### Description of fields
| Fields     | Description                                             |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| tag        | Mark the annotated classes as different groups          |
| isDefault  | Differ the classes with default one or not              |
| priority   | Indicate the priority of each classes with the same tag |

> For more examples, see the code in the project. [Java Example](https://github.com/JoelZhu/CompileScanner/tree/main/app_sample_java) | [Kotlin Example](https://github.com/JoelZhu/CompileScanner/tree/main/app_sample_kotlin) | [Multi Modules Usage Example](https://github.com/JoelZhu/CompileScanner/tree/main/app_sample_multimodule_app)

### ‚ùó Troubles
If you got compile exceptions or something unexcepted, add the options below in application's build.gradle to open the compile log.
```groovy
android {
}

Scanner {
    enableLog = true
}

dependencies {
}
```
Then, when the problem occured, paste the full compile log into an new issue, and assign to me, i will try my best to resolve the problem as fast as you wish.
